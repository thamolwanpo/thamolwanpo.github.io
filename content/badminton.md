## coaching philosophy

> I believe coaching is more than just teaching technique — it’s about building confidence, trust, and shared purpose. As a singles specialist, I understand the mental and strategic demands of the game. I value open conversation, believing that strong coach-athlete bonds come from mutual understanding and working toward the same goals.
